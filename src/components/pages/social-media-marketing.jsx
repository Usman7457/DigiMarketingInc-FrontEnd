                  <h3>Social Media Marketing Basics:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Understanding social media management is essential for every
                    online business. It is the use of social media platforms
                    like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter or any other
                    platform on which users interact, search for content and
                    share information. Since it plays a great role in awareness
                    of different products/ services and brands, it is important
                    for brands to post content that would satisfy consumers and
                    use the right strategies to stand out in a particular
                    market- instead of creating random promotions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Social Media Marketing (SMM) is about planning, designing
                    and publishing content on different social media platforms.
                    It involves staying active on platforms and understanding
                    your audience to create relevant content.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Social media marketing can also drive website traffic and
                    generate leads. By including links to their website in their
                    social media posts, businesses can encourage users to visit
                    their site and potentially convert into customers.
